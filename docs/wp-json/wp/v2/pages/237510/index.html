After careful consideration, We have made the challenging decision to shut down Point Motion and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/iGnosis\/\">open-sourcing Sound Health<\/a>. This decision follows our sincere efforts to establish a sustainable healthcare business.<\/p>\n<p>Point Motion has been a labor of love, filled with passion and dedication. We envisioned revolutionizing healthcare through innovative technology, music and neuroscience aiming to make a positive impact on countless lives. However, despite our best efforts, we encountered obstacles in achieving sustainable growth.<\/p>\n<p>Making this decision was not easy, but I believe it&#8217;s necessary to make tough choices to pave the way for future success. While this marks the end of Point Motion as it currently exists, it also opens doors to new possibilities.<\/p>\n<p>Through this journey, We have gained invaluable lessons about entrepreneurship, technology, and healthcare. I&#8217;ve personally had the privilege of meeting incredible individuals who share my passion and forming lasting friendships along the way. The support and enthusiasm of our team members, clients, research participants, investors, advisors, and vendors have been instrumental in our journey.<\/p>\n<p>Special thanks to all the team members who did an amazing job bringing the product to reality. Also, special thanks to our investors for enabling us with their support and guidance while we went after building a future that we believed in.<\/p>\n<p>From the side of the company, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who have been part of this journey. Your belief in the mission and unwavering support have meant the world to us. Together, we strived to make a positive impact on healthcare and wellness of aging population, and your contributions have not gone unnoticed.<\/p>\n<p>Point Motion&#8217;s app will remain active until October 31, 2023. During this time, I encourage our users to continue utilizing the app and its features.<\/p>\n<p>For those who have used Point Motion for their healthcare needs, I am committed to ensuring that you have access to your data. All patients will receive an email containing a link to download their data. I am dedicated to ensuring a smooth transition for all users.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or require further assistance, please feel free to reach out to me on my personal email <a href=\"mailto:iam@aman.pro\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener\">iam@aman.pro<\/a>. I am here to address your inquiries and provide support during this transition period and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>You can look into <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/iGnosis\/\">the code<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.pointmotion.us\">quick start documentation<\/a> if you would like to run it for your use-cases.<\/p>\n<p>In closing, I would like to thank you for being a part of the Point Motion community and for your continued support. While this chapter may be ending, our commitment to innovation remains strong.
