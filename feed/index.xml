<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Abstract:</h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Background:</em></h4>



<p>Starting from the late 20th&nbsp;century, the study of Human motion sensing and recognition has seen an increased focus on new technologies, such as motion capture systems and computer vision- based tracking. Marker-based motion tracking has found favor in the health care industry for its accuracy and ability to have a repeatable outcome.[1] This method is high cost, requires implementation in a laboratory environment with high data systems, and relies primarily on algorithms (rather than on in-person providers) to analyze a patient’s movement. New technologies, including improved facial recognition and body movement detection using a 2D camera, have increased the viability and appeal of&nbsp;<em>markerless&nbsp;</em>motion capture methods.</p>



<p>In this paper, we present the Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 toolset by Point Motion Inc., which enables subject matter experts to integrate their targeted programs and protocols for specific patient populations into a 2D motion capture tool that is markerless, capturing the individuals’ movements and tracking their performance over time. Through its auditory feedback system, this technology aims to address further gaps in the current motion capture technology for health care market, including a lack of patient-centered experiences, as well as a lack of reward-based experiences upon completing assigned programs/exercises. The study of this technology is valuable insofar as it provides evidence that the collected data metrics can provide caregivers with information that better supports their clinical decisions and allows them to more effectively monitor their clients remotely.</p>



<p>The ultimate vision of Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 is to allow end users/patients to engage in enriching&nbsp;iactivities through accessible technology, while eliminating the need to implement an external device in order to provide results, thus empowering a greater number of patients and care providers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Main body:</em></h4>



<p>The purpose of this study was to test the Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 toolset for its success in the following areas: as a software that motivates patients for their physical exercise, through auditory feedback; in providing reproducible outcome; in generating instant reports that track performances over time.</p>



<p>We tested these capabilities through a pilot study at St. Mary’s Healthcare System for Children in New York with the support of several individuals, including technology administrators, music therapists, and physical therapists. We worked with this team to identify use cases for the study. 10 patients represented the final selection of use cases: 5 males and 5 females. The group age varied between young children and young adults, with a mean age of 15 years old (Standard Deviation= 8.97, ~9). The group members had differing cognitive and physical challenges and represented four categories of patient populations—inpatients, day program attendees, locomotor training (LT) patients, and music therapy group attendees—allowing for the assessment of different patient populations&#8217; needs. The variation of targeted goals within those populations allowed for further diversification of the group.</p>



<p>Total duration of the pilot study was 3 months, from September 16th, 2019 until December 16th, 2019. The Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 motion capture technology consists of capturing 17 keypoints in the human body: 5 points in the head and 12 others in the upper and lower body extremities. The end user/patient is asked to match represented poses that activate and deactivate sounds upon completion. The poses are designated by the subject matter expert and run by the patient with the specialist in a facility, or with a guardian remotely.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Conclusion:</em></h4>



<p>We registered 870 minutes of total programs run, with 15 average sessions per month. Total sessions run was 29 sessions, with an average of 22 minutes per session. In all sessions, we were able to demonstrate the use of this technology run through common digital devices such as tablets and computers using the built-in camera, and no additional device.</p>



<p>Limitations of Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 are mainly capability for tracking only one person per screen and tendency of cameras to pick a bulky object in a poor environment (i.e. poor lighting, busy backgrounds, etc.). Improvements are possible with integration of additional accuracy and model training.</p>



<p>This pilot resulted in 3 main groups, based on the amount of time spent on gameplay. The first group represents 5 participants, who spent 15 minutes or more on the session. The second group represents 4 participants, who spent less than 15 minutes in the gameplay. The third group was composed of a single participant who registered less than 5 minutes in gameplay. With a registered 70% retention rate in this pilot, we were able to confirm significant motivational experiences via Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0, as well as significant opportunity for use of the toolset in remote care (presenting revenue generation opportunities for care centers).<img decoding="async" width="54.480000" height="0.720000" src="blob:/a99ad0b7-5190-41ab-aaa0-bdda983f50e6" alt="page4image42570208"></p>



<p>The software program/activity Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 showed ability to collect data automatically, allowing for generated reports showing performance over time and scores on specific tasks related to regular or rehabilitative exercise. Perhaps most valuably: This study showcased the ability of the Helping FriendsTM 1.0 toolset to create a variety of engaging experiences for different patient populations and to motivate them while acting on their general wellness.</p>



<p>The Quadruple Aim of health care (improved patient experience; better outcomes and improving populations’ health; lower costs of care; and improved clinical experience) was used as the ultimate measure of discussed findings. The abilities of Helping FriendsTM 1.0 demonstrated in this study contributed to those aims, supporting the claim that “allowing end users/patients to engage in enriching&nbsp;iiactivities through accessible technology, while eliminating the need to implement an external device in order to provide results, will empower a greater number of patients and care providers.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction:<br></h2>



<p>Starting from the late 20th&nbsp;century, the study of Human motion sensing and recognition has seen increased focus on new technologies, such as motion capture systems and motion analysis processes, across numerous industries.[1] Motion tracking for individuals in rehabilitation has been a topic of research and discussion among professionals since the 1980s[2], leading to the implementation of the marker-based motion tracking technologies seen most often in health care settings today. Marker-based motion tracking has found favor in the health care industry for its accuracy and ability to have a repeatable outcome.[1] However, new technologies, including improved facial recognition and body movement detection using a 2D camera, have increased the viability and appeal of&nbsp;<em>markerless&nbsp;</em>motion capture methods.The goal of motion capture is to record and analyze human motion, and its power as pertains to health care lies in the potential for widespread application. While marker-based motion tracking technology has been the preferred solution for select patient groups—such as gate tracking and joint rehabilitation in the treatment of athletes and artistic performers—there remains the issue of accessibility. Marker-based motion tracking is high cost, requires implementation in a laboratory environment with high data systems, and relies primarily on algorithms (rather than on the patient-centered care of in-person providers) to analyze a patient’s movements. Each of these factors narrows accessibility for a wide range of individuals who could uniquely benefit from motion capture technology.</p>



<p><br>The use of&nbsp;<em>markerless&nbsp;</em>technology in health care is now feasible and fits the needs of multiple patient populations. This study tests the use of&nbsp;<em>markerless&nbsp;</em>2D technology in health care settings, a technology that meanwhile addresses further gaps in the current market: a lack of patient- centered experiences using motion capture technology, as well as a lack of reward-based experiences upon completing assigned programs/exercises. Our ultimate vision is that allowing the end users/patients to engage in enriching&nbsp;iiiactivities through accessible technology, while eliminating the need to implement an external device in order to provide results, will empower a greater number of patients and care providers.</p>



<p>This study provides a discussion of several use-cases of the presented Point Motion Inc. technology, Helping FriendsTM 1.0. Two-dimensional motion tracking uses simple body models [3]; it assesses movements in the arms, neck mobility, trunk control, lower body movement, and the different degrees of those movements. The technology allows for six degrees of freedom (6DoF) while the patient moves in a 3D space. Point Motion Inc.’s technology uses the built-in camera (such as in computers and tablets) for movement tracking. Motions are captured and automatically entered into an electronic data record platform, providing the medical core with information about patients’ performance over time. (For further analysis, like investigating risks associated with different sports techniques, more complex 3D models with extensive laboratory set-ups are required.) Through the toolset, specialists have the capacity to queue assigned programs remotely, setting a mastery level and target for each patient.</p>



<p>From the patient perspective: A series of movements are displayed, and the patient attempts to match the movements. Completion of programs provides data on a provided portal that registers success or failure to match poses, i.e. right arm up, leg extension for balance, 90-degree elbow bend, etc. Once the patient hits their goal, they move on to the next assigned task in the program queue.</p>



<p>With concern for the current technology gaps in patient-centered and reward-based experiences [3, 4], the motion capture tool of Point Motion Inc. allows for an auditory feedback system, where movements trigger musical phrases, narration, and songs. The platform allows the loading of programs that has defined outcomes; subject matters experts publish a ‘rehabilitation and yoga flow program’, ‘autism and connecting in rhythms program’, ‘Parkinson and balance measurement program’, etc., where every program has specific sounds and movements libraries and assigned targets to be mastered by the patient. The musical aspect prompts the patient and guides them to the completion of tasks, using a cause-effect mechanism.</p>



<p>The presented tool is meant to capture relevant data that provides clinical insight—not treat, cure, or diagnose a condition. It is sufficient to say that this study of the Helping FriendsTM 1.0 toolset is valuable insofar as it provides evidence that the collected data metrics can provide</p>



<p>caregivers with information that better supports their clinical decisions—and allows them to more effectively monitor their clients remotely.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Methodology:</h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sample Description:</h4>



<p>The purpose of this study is to test the Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 toolset for success in the following areas:</p>



<ol>
<li>as a software that motivates users/patients for their physical activity, through auditory feedback</li>



<li>in providing reproducible outcomes</li>



<li>in generating instant reports that track performances over time.</li>
</ol>



<p>During our pilot program, we were supported by a team that helped run the pilot post- onboarding and training. The team was composed of the members in Table 1:</p>

<p>We have worked with this team to identify use cases and best participants to fit this study. The resulting design was a group of 10 patients, 5 males and 5 females, from a group of 21 overall qualified patients. The group age varied between young kids and young adults, with a mean age of ~15 (15.3) years old (standard deviation= 8.97).<img decoding="async" width="55.440000" height="0.480000" src="blob:/72ea1776-193c-41fb-9a08-48aedfa1535b" alt="page7image42268896"></p>



<p>Four categories of patient populations were part of this pilot: inpatients, day program attendees, locomotor training (LT) patients, and music therapy group attendees. We note that inpatients were also part of the music therapy group.</p>



<p>The patients had different cognitive and physical challenges. Having a heterogenous group, in gender, health needs, and age, was intended for a better understanding of different patient populations’ needs. The variation of targeted outcomes through specific protocols allowed for the diversification of the group. This diversification also allowed for differing sessions and number of templates run per client. We will discuss session numbers and duration per category in the Results section.</p>

<p><em><strong>1. Markerless Two-Dimensional Motion Capture:</strong></em></p>



<p>The motion capture tool presented is the Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 toolset by Point Motion Inc. The toolset’s motion capture technology consists of capturing 17 keypoints in the human body: 5 points in the head and 12 others in the upper and lower body extremities (Figure 1). The appearing skeleton is a representation of calibration using this system (Figure 2). We will review the technology in terms of accuracy,&nbsp;reproducible outcomes, and metrics collected in the next section of this paper.</p>

<p>tracking without handheld or wearable devices, in favor of using the built-in camera on common electronic devices such as computers or tablets. Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 is a designed pose matching experience in which patients are cued to match displayed poses on the screen and, when matched correctly, receive auditory feedback in the form of music. By moving their bodies, patients trigger and ‘make’ music.</p>



<p>The used technology allows for pose estimation via computer vision techniques that detect human figures in images and videos. Meaning that one could determine, for example, where a patient’s elbow shows up in an image. To be clear, this technology does not recognize&nbsp;<em>who&nbsp;</em>is in an image; there is no personal identifiable information associated with the pose detection. The algorithm simply estimates the location of key body joints (Table 2)<img decoding="async" width="145.200000" height="0.480000" src="blob:/0420fd19-35e0-4ce4-9828-fd4177bf99fa" alt="page9image42123888">&nbsp;<img decoding="async" width="145.200000" height="0.480000" src="blob:/d78f7db1-5c96-4750-a3ad-9b5c04d7f6c1" alt="page9image42124096"><img decoding="async" width="145.200000" height="0.480000" src="blob:/70619ef0-ba36-490a-af3c-e26d43ea539e" alt="page9image42124304">&nbsp;<img decoding="async" width="145.200000" height="0.480000" src="blob:/efcb1f66-239d-4692-add6-14ada347a6a1" alt="page9image42124512">&nbsp;<img decoding="async" width="145.200000" height="0.480000" src="blob:/32526aa1-2bab-4f40-8271-4d4ee1d6862f" alt="page9image42124720">The most accurate set up method is to choose a blank wall without bulky objects, poor lighting, or busy backgrounds. The calibration screen will appear before the start of the gameplay, allowing the patient to see what the camera is capturing at that moment. Accordingly, patients</p>



<p>will move closer or further to ensure positioning within the camera’s window, so that it registers the correct poses and/or durations during the session.</p>



<p>It is permissible to have the administrator help the patient with setup if needed. In that scenario, once the administrator sees a functioning image in the calibration screen, they can exit the calibration and start the game for the concerned patient. Only the patient should be present in front of the camera so as not to skew the captured data.</p>

<p>In this study, there were no significant differences in screen conditions and digital environments displayed during participants’ game sessions.</p>



<p><em>2.&nbsp;<strong>Automated Data Collection:</strong></em></p>



<p>Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 by Point Motion Inc. is synched to the Electronic Data Record (EDR) by UnitusTI, where data is hosted, and reports are generated. This system has the capability of delivering a consistent user experience, with reproducible outcomes. It is important to note that the motion capture and data collection processes used are for gross movements, not finer movements. Our data collection includes metrics that reflect a patient’s range of motion, endurance, reaction time, and patient responses to visual/verbal cues within the game. Every protocol integrated in the motion capture tool has different targeted outcomes. In order for the automated data collection to succeed, the motion-capture component must register those movements. The resulting data reflects specific metrics that are collected throughout the process of reproducing the movements shown on the patient’s screen. The patient’s movements are meanwhile compared to the target set by the specialist.</p>



<p>Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 allows for the collection and automatic storage of 6 metrics per patient account, via the EDR by UnitusTI: correct poses, incorrect poses, no response, data collection poses, reaction time, and reaction time general. This data allows doctors to assess performance of their patients over time and provides insights into the cognitive and physical conditions of the patient. (See Table 3, below).</p>

<p>In this study, specialists selected their preferred metrics for automated reports and graph generation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Integrated Program:&nbsp;<em>Sound Sage</em></h4>



<p>The Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 toolset is centered around ‘bringing music where people need it most’. The cause-effect mechanism represented when musical phrases are activated upon movement execution, , is used to enable higher patient engagement.</p>



<p>It would seem that most specialists realize the potential of music to facilitate enjoyment and engagement for patients in health care contexts. However, many health care professionals may not realize the potential for using musical experiences to address specific client needs in a meaningful and quantifiable way. In fact, music has been used effectively as a therapeutic medium to support engagement in physical activity,[5, 6, 7] increase endurance during physical activity,[8, 9, 10] and support motor planning.[11,12,13] In this study, subject matter experts leveraged the presented toolset into targeted programs with identified practical outcomes. These programs are supported with a HIPAA and FERPA compliant portal for managing client programs and generating session reports.</p>



<p><em>SoundSage</em>programwascreatedbyDr.ThomasFoster,usingtheHelpingFriendsTM1.0 toolset as an ongoing assessment tool and as protocol for intervention. The&nbsp;<em>Sound Sage&nbsp;</em>program presents an enriching&nbsp;iv&nbsp;and meaningful music-based platform for supporting growth in client engagement, sustained attention, motor planning, proprioception, range of motion, strength, and endurance.&nbsp;<em>Sound Sage&nbsp;</em>program was used in this pilot for its relevance to all age ranges and abilities.&nbsp;<em>The program’s&nbsp;</em>compositional elements (frequencies, tempos, and textures) are informed by the latest research in the fields of music and sound therapy and allows it to be equally beneficial for reducing anxiety.</p>



<p>The program templates include a variety of structures and progressive experience types in order to meet data collection and intervention needs for all age ranges and ability levels of the selected group.</p>

<p>In this study, the music was customized per participant preference or most engaging music criterion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Results:</h2>



<p>The duration of product use for this pilot study was two months, from October 17th&nbsp;to December 18th, 2020 (onboarding and training period not included). We registered a total of 870 minutes use of the Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 toolset with clients at St. Mary’s Healthcare System for Children. We registered a 70% retention rate in the program, with 1 registered case of drop-out because of the participant’s lower engagement towards the gameplay.</p>



<p>Participants spent an average 22-minute per session (Standard Deviation= 13.91) engaging in music activation through movement mirroring (i.e. lifting both arms, one arm). The registered time included administration of test and setup. Note that time of test and setup administration decreases throughout the toolset adoption lifecycle.</p>



<p>This pilot resulted an observation in variance in the amount of time spent on gameplay (Table 5). The participants were apportioned into 3 groups: Group 1: represents 5 participants, who registered 15 minutes or more on average play per session. Group 2: composed of 4 participants, who spent 15 or less minutes on average play per session. Group 3: one participant, who spent less than 5min on gameplay.</p>



<p>The number of sessions per patient varied for reasons classified as: different needs/different available program templates, adoption rate per client, engagement rate per client, and case specificities. Some patients, despite their high motivation to engage in the gameplay, were presented challenges in accurate motion capture due to the need for physical support from others. This resulted in limited sessions with that respective patient population (LT).</p>



<p>The use of the Helping FriendsTM 1.0 toolset of Point Motion Inc. successfully allowed for: execution of auditory feedback upon accurately mirrored movements, automated data collection, and enabled customized care per patient needs via the provided&nbsp;<em>Sound Sage&nbsp;</em>program/music options.</p>

<p>Table 5. Study Results</p>



<p>The Electronic Data Records platform’s reporting system generated graphs representing patient performance over time (allowing for i.e. qualifications to outcome-based reimbursement codes), as well as on-demand full reports of patient performance. All metrics and data were collected automatically, without a manual data entry process. The system allowed for collection of different metrics in different forms: Label (i.e. Discrete Trial, Task Analysis), Time (i.e. Duration), and Numeric (i.e. Frequency).</p>



<p>Below are two graphs representing patient performance graph representations (Figure 3, Figure 4). The x-axis represents time (dates of the software use). The y-axis represents the percentage of success rate per program template (per selected patient profile).</p>



<p>Note: While using the software, the administrator was able to zoom in and out of the graph to view the x- axis in months, weeks, or days.</p>



<p>Figure 4. Graph 1: A Single Point Representation</p>



<p>A single point representation: represents the first attempt/game of the patient in his respective target. He scored a 90% on the total gameplay, meaning he missed 10% of the movements or entered some poses late. A secondary round of gameplay provides an additional score that can be used for a two-time use graph.</p>



<p>Pilot Study</p>



<p><img decoding="async" width="455.450000" height="199.076000" src="blob:/cd83b0e2-78a0-46c7-923d-49cc75d6592f" alt="page17image45847632"></p>



<p>Figure 5. Graph 2: Line Graph Representation</p>



<p>Line graph representation: visualizes the value of the patient’s performance over 1 month, within the Yoga Flow- Upper Body Mobility Program template run within the Music Therapy session. The software’s line graph generation enabled us to see baseline trends in the patient’s activity. In short time frames, we identify the baseline or trend line. Extreme patterns in performance can be identified over the long term. It is expected that pattern deviations from this baseline would be identifiable through longer reporting (8+ months).</p>



<p>Unexpected Observations:</p>



<p>During this pilot study, we noted one individual who was able to execute a pose previously misjudged not feasible. This patient has severely limited activity of his right arm. To his physical therapists’ surprise, he was able to raise his right arm during gameplay.</p>



<p>In a second case, among the participants in the music therapy program: the music therapist reported that a patient who, upon hearing the&nbsp;<em>Sound Sage&nbsp;</em>program music outside of her gameplay session, continued to simulate the correlated pose.</p>



<p>Discussing Findings:</p>



<p>During this pilot study, we demonstrated the ability of the Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 toolset to: automatically collect data per patient during clinical sessions via the Electronic Data Record</p>



<p><img decoding="async" width="467.792800" height="188.550000" src="blob:/14bc1e25-5a0e-4f4e-8842-805d05441b52" alt="page18image45738352">&nbsp;<img decoding="async" width="127.440000" height="0.720000" src="blob:/edc6f263-57cb-4951-bbbe-956cf668958f" alt="page18image45741056"></p>



<p>platform UnitusTI; provide auditory feedback upon pose completion via the&nbsp;<em>Sound Sage&nbsp;</em>program; and generate meaningful reports showing performance over time and scores on specific tasks related to regular or rehabilitative exercise.</p>



<p>The presented solution provided reproducible outcomes when used according to Point Motion, Inc. guidelines for the optimal tracking setting (lighting, background, etc.). The presented solution motivated patients for their physical exercise through the auditory feedback. The instant reports generated by this solution were able to accommodate several metrics, as specified by the specialist, enabling targeted tracking of patients’ cognitive and motor function ability performances over time.</p>



<p><strong>Clinical Relevance:</strong></p>



<p>As innovators in the current landscape of health care, we have chosen to keep the Quadruple Aim of health care as the ultimate reference for, and measure of, the Helping FriendsTM 1.0 toolset and this pilot study:</p>



<p><em>1. Improved Patient Experience:</em></p>



<p>The Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 toolset improved patient experience by motivating patients through auditory feedback. We witnessed the gamification of therapy, which gave patients a way of expression through music, meanwhile reducing the burden of their challenges. Our unexpected observations and the 70 % retention rate support this conclusion. A further example: In a music therapy session, we observed one of the participants using the software to trigger and stimulate drum sounds while the music therapist played guitar. This represents a shift in the patient from passive member to active member, enrichingv&nbsp;the patient’s therapeutic experience. Furthermore, the use of visual display components and activated sounds were successfully executed for all patients in a customized manner. Administrators were able to select specific programs to fit patients’ respective needs and habits, allowing for more customized care. (The Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;2.0 version will further customize the gameplay experience by providing different gameplay environment choices [i.e. park setting, or a gym setting].)</p>



<p><em>2. Better Outcomes and Improving Populations’ Health:</em></p>



<p>The Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 toolset simultaneously aims to facilitate better health care outcomes. In addition to increasing patient engagement in care and education, the toolset equipped caregivers to more closely and consistently track patient performance over time, as illustrated by our software-generated graphs (Figure 3, Figure 4). Although the Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 toolset is not a medical tool, it enabled reproducible monitoring of general wellness and cognitive activity by synching automated data collection to the Electronic Data Record (EDR) for all gameplay throughout the study. Furthermore, specialists are able to use the toolset to increase activity per patient by assigning exercises and following performance remotely. Research has shown that home care helps health care institutions not just by reducing costs but also by reducing thenumber of patient readmissions. Notably, the level of physical activity registered for those at- home patients is higher than that of patients in hospitals. [14],[15]</p>



<p><em>3. Lower Costs of Care:</em></p>



<p>According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the U.S. spent 18% of GDP on health care in 2020.[16] Efforts to decrease doctor visits by ensuring good health for populations, continuous remote surveillance, and affordability of doctor visits are a central focus in today’s health care landscape. During this pilot program, the remote setting/telehealth was not used, as all patients chosen for the pilot visit the hospital regularly (either inpatients, or day care). A primary goal of this study was to ensure that the setup, onboarding and training, and program execution were viable. However, the Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 toolset software has remote capabilities embedded. Pre-loaded programs can be offered to the patient from the comfort of their home, and reports can be accessed by their specialist who can take actions if necessary. The 70% retention rate in this program indicates significant opportunity for use of the toolset in remote care. In an upcoming study, we will be analyzing remote assessment use cases in more depth.</p>



<p><em>4. Improved Clinical Experience:</em></p>



<p>The pressure that the medical core currently faces has raised concerns about provider burnout. The Medscape’s 2020 Physician Lifestyle Report showed that among 15,000 respondents 42% of physician respondents reported burnout. [17] Additionally, attention has been brought to the correlation between decreased staff engagement/burnout and lower patient satisfaction [18]. The successful execution of the automated data collection feature in this study shows promise as a positive player in the burnout solution. The Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 toolset alleviates administrative burdens by eliminating all manual data entry process during a session. Meanwhile, the toolset’s program queue feature and cloud solution capabilities allow the specialist to assign programs in advance and access data from anywhere, anytime.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reimbursement and Telehealth Applications:</strong></h4>



<p>The Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 toolset and the integrated UnitusTI EDR platform are HIPAA and FERPA compliant. It is worth noting that, adoption of this toolset, allows interventions to move beyond traditional video techniques and verbal reporting.</p>



<p>While Telehealth technology has been around for nearly 40 years, we see a widespread on its implementation especially during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. As we continue the path to finding the best ways for care delivery, it is important to acknowledge the exponential growth telehealth is seeing and the improvement of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) tools that will empower both the caregiver and the care recipient. Studies in the field forecast growth in telehealth that is paralleled with a growth in remote diagnostic equipment.</p>



<p>In terms of reimbursement: With our current results, if an institution has 100 clients, and we register 3 sessions/month per client (2.9), 70 will be retained. The health care institution could perform 203 sessions per month, equating to billing and collecting reimbursement at approximately $8,120 per month in revenue ($97,440 per year). This estimate assumes a very conservative average collection of $40 per session.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Limitations:</h4>



<p>The Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 software has areas of improvement that indicate opportunities to surpass current capabilities:</p>



<p>Currently, the accuracy of Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 is negatively impacted when incorrectly set up, or when set up in a poor environment. Poor environments include variables which negatively impact the accuracy of the motion capture software, i.e. very bright or very poor lighting and background activity (such as people or bulky objects behind the person).</p>



<p>If there are multiple persons in the motion capture framing, keypoints from those persons will be estimated as part of the patient’s single pose—meaning that even if the patient accurately executes the pose, the system will capture, for example, one person’s right arm and another person’s left knee and fail to register the accurate patient movement as success.[19]</p>



<p>With regards to program selection, the caregiver must decide the exercises and the programs for the patient. Point Motion, Inc. has filed a patent for machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate that process.</p>



<p>The Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 automated data collection library has two different functions for different use cases: tracking a single user or tracking multiple users. The fastest and most accurate tracking comes in the form of single user tracking, which is where Point Motion, Inc. has chosen to start for the reliability and consistency of the technology. One limitation of single user tracking is that locomotor training (LT) program patients do not benefit highly from this version of the toolset. During this study, there were challenges with tracking because of the multiple individuals needed to support the patient’s stillness during exercises requiring trunk flexion. The best option to accommodate this need was to keep the camera pointing to the body parts of the concerned patient, without capturing parts of the supporters’ bodies. Because we used a tablet on a tripod, it was possible to control, to a degree, the angle of the capture—but not for every exercise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion:</h2>



<p>This pilot study demonstrates significant innovation in the field of&nbsp;<em>markerless&nbsp;</em>motion detection technology: a way of managing and assigning specific programs for different patient populations</p>



<p>and target specific outcomes. The technology is accessible, allows for data collection in real time on the cloud and distributed remotely or in-person on demand.</p>



<p>Perhaps most valuably: This study showcased the ability of the Helping FriendsTM 1.0 toolset to create a variety of engaging experiences for different patient populations and to motivate them while acting on their general wellness (i.e. sustained attention for cognitively challenged individuals, pose accuracy for physically challenged individuals, and prime/free play for less responsive individuals).</p>



<p>The ultimate vision of Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 is to allow end users/patients to engage in enrichingvi&nbsp;activities through accessible technology, while eliminating the need to implement sophisticated external devices in order to monitor patient’s adherence and progress over time. Thus, in a larger scheme, this technology aims to empower a greater number of patients and care providers. Using the Quadruple Aim of Healthcare as a measure of, and guide to, a personalized care method that improves both patient and clinical experience, contribute to improve overall health outcomes, while decreasing costs.</p>



<p>In today’s changing world, where remote care services are rapidly becoming the new norm and Telehealth services are no longer a luxury but a necessity to monitor clients’ performance, Helping FriendsTM&nbsp;1.0 is a tool that allows for innovation at lower costs and, above all, wider accessibility of care despite social and economic disparities.</p>

<p>We concluded a successful pilot study at Boston Public School.</p>



<p>Students appeared motivated by the novel technology and demonstrated decreased levels of distress as evidenced by calmer bodies, more intentional movements, and decreased crying behaviors. Students also appeared motivated by the use of the different modes as evidenced by increased attention and increased range of motion.<br>During the virtual instrument mode, students were able to develop cause and effect skills, which helped them to develop a sense of self and their relationship with the world.</p>
